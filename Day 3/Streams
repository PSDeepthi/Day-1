List various classes available for reading / writing
 
 a) byte data
 
 b) character data (Strings)
 
 c) files
 
 d) objects

Understand which i/o streams to use in which scenario.


Scenarios:

    Byte Data (a):
        Use InputStream and OutputStream for reading and writing raw bytes.
        Use specific classes like FileInputStream and FileOutputStream for file-based operations.
        Use ByteArrayInputStream and ByteArrayOutputStream for in-memory byte array operations.

    Character Data (b):
        Use Reader and Writer for reading and writing character data.
        Use specific classes like FileReader and FileWriter for file-based character operations.
        Use StringReader and StringWriter for string-based operations.

    Files (c):
        Use Files class for various file-related operations.
        Use BufferedReader and BufferedWriter for efficient text file reading and writing.

    Objects (d):
        Use ObjectInputStream and ObjectOutputStream for reading and writing objects.
        These classes are often used in serialization scenarios.

 Additionally, consider using buffered classes (BufferedReader/BufferedWriter) for improved performance when dealing with character-based data.
